* scripts

collection of small utilities i've written / adapted / found throughout the years
some of these have links to other odd programs i might be using- read before you run and all that

since these are going to be included in your ~$PATH~, it's good practice to make sure they're not writeable by just any schmuck with a login
the makefile will manage setting up permissions and symlinking them to /usr/local/bin with ~stow~
currently, that's all packed into default, so just set up with ~sudo make~


** todo

- [ ] ensure posix compliance (most should be compliant)
- [ ] rework naming convention? maybe prefix with , to differentiate from system utilities
- [ ] makefile options per device - more feasible after when i get all my old machines back online
- [ ] clean up a few more unnecessary commands (especially in ~display/~)
